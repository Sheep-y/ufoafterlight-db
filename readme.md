Sheepy's UFO: Afterlight database
=================================

For project description and deliverable, see the [main branch](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/).

JavaScript code is in the `res` folder, and data is in data folder.
JavaScript namespace is 'ufoal', defined in `core.js`.
Most code is in `ui.js`, with event handlers in `event.js`.

Images are embedded as data uri.  Other contents are inlined as is.

The underscore in the code is a lightweight custom library, but code is mostly ES5.

A single deliverable file is built using a custom build tool.
All it does for this project is merging multiple files into one, so it should be easy to rewrite for your preferred build tool.
Alternatively, it is even easier to change the links to html links, totally removing the build process.
