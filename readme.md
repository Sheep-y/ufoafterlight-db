Sheepy's UFO: Afterlight database
=================================

For project description and downloadable file, see the [main branch](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/).

JavaScript code is in [`res`](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/res) folder, and data is in [`data`](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/data) folder.
JavaScript namespace is 'ufoal', defined in [`core.js`](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/res/core.js).

[Images](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/img) are embedded as data uri.
Other contents are inlined as is.

The underscore in the code is a lightweight custom library, but the program is mostly ES5.

A custom build tool (a Java jar) is included in the [project root](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/).
All it does is merging files, so it should be easy to rewrite for your preferred build tool, or manually change to html links.
