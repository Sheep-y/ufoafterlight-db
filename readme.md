Sheepy's UFO: Afterlight database
=================================

For project description and deliverable, see the [main branch](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/).

JavaScript code is in [`res`](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/res) folder, and data is in [`data`](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/data) folder.
JavaScript namespace is 'ufoal', defined in [`core.js`](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/res/core.js).

[Images](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/img) are embedded as data uri.  Other contents are inlined as is.

The underscore in the code is a lightweight custom library, but the program is mostly ES5.

A single deliverable file is built using a custom build tool.
All it does for this project is merging files, so it should be easy to rewrite for your preferred build tool.
Alternatively, it is even easier to change the links to html links, totally removing the build process.

This is a small project. To hell with backward compatibility.
