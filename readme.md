Sheepy's UFO: Afterlight database
=================================

**[&lt;Launch database>](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/r20150130/index.html)**
**For source code, see [development branch](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development).**

This database shows the stats and dependancy tree of selected technology, equipment, building, station, or training.
It also shows the composition of enemy squards and information on enemy units.

Instead of opening it online, you can also right click the launch link and save it on your harddisk / SD card to use it anywhere.

This is inspired by [Kircket's Tech Tree](http://www.irodemine.com/afterlit/), sparked by a [discussion on Stream](http://steamcommunity.com/app/237950/discussions/0/616188677801999309/#c619568793974409287).
Active development is NOT planned, because this database is a small sidetrack from the author's focus of the [UFO: Afterlight wiki](http://ufoafterblank.wikia.com/) on Wikia.
