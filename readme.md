Sheepy's UFO: Afterlight database
=================================

**[&lt;Launch database>](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/r20141116/index.html)**
**For source code, see [development branch](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development).**

This database shows the stats, requirements, and futures of selected technology, equipment, building, station, or training.
It also lists unused items and technologies, some with descriptions.

Instead of opening it online, you can also right click the launch link and save it on your harddisk / SD card to bring it anywhere.

This is an alternate implementation of [Kircket's Tech Tree](http://www.irodemine.com/afterlit/), sparked by a [discussion on Stream](http://steamcommunity.com/app/237950/discussions/0/616188677801999309/#c619568793974409287).
Active development is NOT planned, because this database is a small sidetrack from the author's focus of the [UFO: Afterlight wiki](http://ufoafterblank.wikia.com/) on Wikia.
