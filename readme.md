Sheepy's UFO: Afterlight database
=================================

**For source code, see [development branch](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development).**

This is an alternate implementation of [Kircket's Tech Tree](http://www.irodemine.com/afterlit/), triggered by a [discussion on Stream](http://steamcommunity.com/app/237950/discussions/0/616188677801999309/#c619568793974409287).

You can [try it online here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/master/index.html),
or right click the link and save it on your harddisk / SD card to bring it anywhere.

Active development is NOT planned, because this database is a small sidetrack from the author's focus of the [UFO: Afterlight wiki](http://ufoafterblank.wikia.com/) on Wikia.
