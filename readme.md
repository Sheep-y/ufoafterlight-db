Sheepy's UFO: Afterlight database
=================================

[Launch database](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/r20141026/index.html).
**For source code, see [development branch](https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development).**

This database shows the description and requirements of selected technology, equipment, building, station, or training, if any.
For technologies and buildings, it also shows the research / production / trainings that they would enable.
You can also right click the launch link and save it on your harddisk / SD card to bring it anywhere.

This is an alternate implementation of [Kircket's Tech Tree](http://www.irodemine.com/afterlit/), sparked by a [discussion on Stream](http://steamcommunity.com/app/237950/discussions/0/616188677801999309/#c619568793974409287).
Active development is NOT planned, because this database is a small sidetrack from the author's focus of the [UFO: Afterlight wiki](http://ufoafterblank.wikia.com/) on Wikia.
