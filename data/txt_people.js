"1_bio":"Ute Heinemann was born in Karl-Marx-Stadt, later Kamnitz, in Central Europe. In 2000, she represented her country at the Olympic Games in the former United States. She was one of the fiercest warriors against the Reticulans in the war preceding the exile to Mars. Then, she fought together with Benat Haradze and this experience binds them to this day.",
"2_bio":"Harald Zamyatin was a young boy when he arrived on Mars. His father was one of the pioneers who died settling on this harsh planet. Harald grew up to be his proud successor and he distinguished himself on many important missions all over Mars. His wife died when she gave birth to his daughter - Olga.",
"3_bio":"Diego is one of the strongest men in the colony. He did not inherit the intellect of his father, but in times of peace he has been a worthy worker. Now he can show his valor as a soldier. He is a very good friend both to Oliver and Samantha Svensson.",
"4_bio":"Samantha has been a good organizer and skilful worker. Now she must use her talent as one of our soldiers. She has been deeply in love with her husband, Oliver Svensson, for a long time. She is also a good friend to Diego Ramirez , who is the only other person the same age as her and her husband.",
"5_bio":"Hikaru Yoshimori is a silent and patient man originally from Japan. Nobody in the colony knows more about Mars - it is said that he can survive even without a spacesuit, but that is probably only a rumor. To ensure there are enough children in the colony, he married Agnieszka and  they have a son - Tadeusz.",
"6_bio":"Tadeusz Yoshimori sometimes comes across as being the child of different parents to Hikaru and Agnieszka. He is air-headed and careless. He's the colony's medic and underwent basic military training, so he can go on combat missions with other soldiers.",
"7_bio":"Gene Lawrence was in charge of the excavation site when Martian drones appeared, and she was there when Jurgen Heinemann was killed. Being a very sensitive woman, this really affected her deeply. Since the death of her husband, he now has to take care of their daughter Rita alone.",

"10_bio":"Benat Haradze is descended from an old family of Caucasian warriors. His childhood experiences fighting fiercely against the Reticulans on the Earth have come in very useful. An old friendship from this time connects him closely to Ute Heinemann. He is also an expert in pyrotechnics and explosive substances.",
"11_bio":"Oliver Svensson's charisma attracts all women in the colony, but only Samantha may call herself Oliver's wife. He inherited his strength and brains from his father, a Norwegian fishermen, who joined the Mars' colony campaign at the very last moment. Diego Ramirez is his very good friend.",
"12_bio":"Vera Schrooten could be likened to a queen. She lovingly supports her husband Willhelm in governing the colony and at the same time she takes care of all its members, especially young Mark Wells, the son of her best friend Jacqueline.",
"13_bio":"The most experienced scientist in the colony. Sometimes his intellectual prowess makes him hard to get on with and he can seem arrogant to other people. His work and studies did not allow him to spend much time with his son - Diego, who badly missed father's attention.",
"14_bio":"Inge Heinemann is grand-daughter of Ute, and daughter of Jurgen Heinemann, who died heroically, when the Martian drones appeared for the first time. The death of her father deepened her introversion even further and it significantly complicates her work as human resources manager.",
"15_bio":"Agnieszka comes from a religious family and she upholds a strong sense of tradition and moral values. She regarded it as her duty to marry Hikaru Yoshimori, although they have almost nothing in common except the care of their son, Tadeusz. Her talents make her ideally suited for the job of colony librarian.",
"16_bio":"Jacqueline Wells is like a black fountain bubbling with the joys of life. She offers a constant stream of jokes and good humor.

She is good friends with Vera Schrooten, first lady of the colony.",
"17_bio":"Mary's parents came from Nigeria and they were the only colonists from Africa. They died soon after Mary was born, so she was brought up by people who were complete strangers to her. She bore this with dignity and this and other qualities make her the perfect diplomat.",
"18_bio":"Edgar Barker is of Irish origin. He misses the pubs and the beer, although he has never experienced them himself. He prefers to work alone in the store and continuously reorganizes the shelves and items on them. On the positive side, if you ever need anything, you can be sure he will find it in a few seconds.",
"19_bio":"Willhelm Schrooten was just a child, when he was brought from Earth and he carries that memory deeply in his heart. His vision of Mars as his new home has guided the colony through all the hard times and it was natural that he succeeded as leader when his predecessor died. And if he sometimes feels sad and tired, there is always his wife Vera to comfort him.",
"20_bio":"Neil Barker is a gifted, middle aged man. He was made steward of the home base at a very young age, as he demonstrated many times to be capable both of organizational and technical matters. Unlike his father, he is sociable and funny, but still he loves Edgar with all his heart. Do not be angry with him if he mocks you a bit.",
"21_bio":"Claude is one of the twin sons of Pauline Lasalle. He is almost indistinguishable from his brother Pierre, both in appearance and character.

"23_bio":"Olga Zamyatina is a beautiful young lady, with looks very similar to her deceased mother. On the other hand, she has determination and a military talent inherited from her father, Harald. Now he has decided to retire, she will take his place and because she learns really fast, she might even quickly become a better warrior than him.",
"24_bio":"Rita is in her rebel teenage phase. In an ideal world, she would be educated for a few more years, but the casualties force us to recruit even people of her age. Her mother - Gene - is not happy about this and if she could, she would participate in every mission together with her daughter in order to protect her, though Rita feels embarrassed at this.",
