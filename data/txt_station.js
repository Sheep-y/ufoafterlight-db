800:"To occupy a territory you must build the geological probe there. The automated probe will start surveying the surrounding regions, reporting data about resources, archeological findings and enemy presence. <br>A geological probe is built by scientists.",
801:"The excavation site is constructed on the ancient Martian ruins. The specialized robots will search the ground for any artifacts that may greatly speed up your research. <br>An excavation site is built by scientists.",
802:"Radars can give you an early warning when enemies are attacking your territory, i.e. efficiently extending the time to solve acute missions. <br>Radar base is built by technicians.",
803:"Radars can aim rockets at the attacking enemy, i.e. destroying most of the raiding parties before they attack.<br>A rocket base is upgraded from a radar base by technicians.",
804:"A terraforming station supports the slow process of terraformation by changing the structure of atmosphere. The more terraforming stations you have, the faster terrraformation and water levels will grow throughout the planet. <br>Terraforming stations are built by scientists.",
805:"An advanced terraforming station contributes to the terraformation process at much higher rate. Thanks to new alian technologies, they also affect the planet’s magnetic field - without this change the higher terraformation levels would be unattainable. <br>Advanced terraforming stations are upgraded from basic terraforming station by scientists.",
806:"A fossil liquid similar to Earth’s crude oil provides energy for your vehicles, the base and all the facilities. The mine contributes to access to fuel according to the deposit’s size <br>Fuel mine stations are built by technicians.",
807:"This is an upgrade of the basic fuel mine, with this source then contributing double the volume to the fuel access. <br>Advanced fuel mines are upgraded from basic fuel mines by technicians.",
808:"Metal is an essential material for both building construction and item production. The mine contributes to access to metal according to the deposit’s size. <br>Metal mine is built by technicians.",
809:"This is an upgrade of the basic metal mine, with this source then contributing double the volume to access to metal. <br>Advanced metal mines are upgraded from basic metal mine by technicians.",
810:"Chemicals are a basic component to the creation of explosives and plastics. The mine contributes to access to chemicals according to the deposit’s size <br>Chemical mines are built by technicians.",
811:"This is an upgrade of the basic chemical mine, with this source then contributing double the volume to access to chemicals. <br>Advanced chemical mines are upgraded from basic chemical mines by technicians.",
812:"Various noble metals are required for the production of new equipment. This mine contributes to access to noble metals according to the deposit’s size. <br>Noble metals mines are built by technicians.",
813:"This is an upgrade of the basic noble metals mine, with this source then contributing double the volume to access to noble mines. <br>Advanced noble metals’ mines are upgraded from basic noble metals’ mines by technicians.",
814:"Lasers and some optical devices require crystals in their production. The mine contributes to the access to the crystals according to the deposit’s size. <br>Crystal mines are built by technicians.",
815:"This is an upgrade  of the basic crystal mine, with this source then contributing double the volume to access to crystals. <br>Advanced crystal mines are upgraded from basic crystal mines by technicians.",
