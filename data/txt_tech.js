"200_done":"The easiest way to treat our soldiers whilst in their spacesuits on the battlefield, is to inject regenerative and analgesic substances into their blood. This treatment does not heal permanent damage, but it enables them to cope with temporary injuries.",
"200_b4":"We need to extend our medical knowledge so that it can be used in battle.",
"201_done":"We have developed two types of stimulants that can be injected into a soldiers’ blood using the medkit. Each of these increases just one of the attributes. The drawback is that they slightly decrease another attribute at the same time.",
"201_b4":"We can develop biochemical stimulants to enhance the combat abilities of our soldiers.",
"202_done":"We have developed the techniques and tools necessary to study alien anatomy and physiology. If the soldiers bring dead aliens back to the main base, we will be able to dissect the corpses and discover their strengths and weaknesses.",
"202_b4":"The need to explore alien anatomy and physiology calls for a completely new set of research methods and techniques.",
"203_done":"The Beastmen are strong and tough creatures, as can be easily seen from their body size. Above that, they enjoy weak regeneration ability. In other aspects, their physiology and anatomy are similar to humans and they are vulnerable to the same kinds of damage. They use mostly seeing and hearing, just as humans, but they also have perfect sense of smell.",
"203_b4":"Studying a Beastman’s body may help us fighting against this enemy.",
"204_done":"The Beastman shamans play important role in their civilization. They carry out the rituals combining mystic and scientific techniques that enable them to control Mars’ dangerous natural elements. They have worthwhile knowledge about biological manipulation. We have also learned from shaman how to use Beastman scanners.",
"204_b4":"The shamans seem to know a lot about the Beastmen’s technology and culture - interrogating them may give us useful information.",
"205_done":"These new medical techniques speed up regeneration of wounded soldiers at our home base. As well as this, we are now able to produce even more effective substances for treating troops on the battlefield. We can cure more temporary damage and remove some of the negative effects caused by the enemy.",
"205_b4":"Recent discoveries suggest that we can greatly improve our medical skills.",
"206_done":"These two new stimulants always boost two attributes instead of just the one and they have no drawbacks like the previous substances. It is possible that we will be able to develop even the more effective ones, once we learn more about Beastmen biotechnology.",
"206_b4":"We can try to create combat stimulants that don’t have any negative side effects.",
"207_done":"The Mars nature forces are not living creatures, but a natural physical phenomenon. It is caused by the planetary magnetic field and disturbing this field in some way would probably be the most effective way to destroy it. In missions, our soldiers do not need to destroy nature forces to successfully finish the mission.",
"207_b4":"These nature forces are very dangerous if met on a mission. We should study them thoroughly.",
"208_done":"The knowledge gained during this project will help us a lot when researching new types of spacesuits and related technologies.",
"208_b4":"The new situation demands that we study more about outdoor survival techniques on Mars’ surface.",
"211_done":"We have developed the tools and techniques necessary to acquire information from aliens whose biology we have explored. It is not necessary to know their language, on the contrary, we may learn the language during the interrogation process.",
"211_b4":"The aliens must know a lot. If we find a way to communicate, and persuade them to share their knowledge, it may prove very useful to progressing our technology.",
"212_done":"Analysis of camera footage shows that Martians built the extended automatic defense system, which is activated when anybody tries to enter their long-deserted dwellings. The robots in this system are independent combat units and they are not just programmed to protect, but also to attack potential intruders anywhere on the planet.",
"212_b4":"When the archeologists entered the Martian ruins, they were attacked by some kind of automatic drone. To be better prepared next time, we should learn more about them.",
"213_done":"We adapted our labor robots and their artificial intelligence so that they can now take part in combat missions. Their electronic brains can learn from experience and so improve the drones’ abilities. Battle drones consist of a chassis, turret and weapon.",
"213_b4":"The Martian battle drones are a great idea. Why not use automatons equipped with weapons and thus save human lives?",
"214_done":"The crawling drones use a similar type of movement to insects - not fast, but steady. Their artificial inteligence is the cause for delays in movement and attacking. Their metal bodies can be detected by electromagnetic scanning. To orientate themselves, they use only normal cameras. We are gaining a basic understanding of how the Martian drones work, later we could repair some of them and include them in our battle team.",
"214_b4":"Our soldiers brought the body of Martian crawling drone back from a mission. We should study its construction.",
"215_done":"The drones’ propulsion uses an electromagnetic field to enable it to effectively levitate above the ground. They move just as easily as any man does. Their metal bodies can be detected by electromagnetic scanning. To orientate themselves, they use only normal cameras. Unfortunately, we cannot reproduce this effect without more information, but we can still set their engines in motion if need arises.",
"215_b4":"Our soldiers brought the body of a Martian levitating drone back from a mission. We should study its construction.",
"216_done":"From now on, Martian drones can be included in our combat squads. We need to find the chassis and the turrets, which can then be repaired once back at the Base. The turret is equipped with our robotic weapons and then the Martian drone can be sent back into battle to fight together with our units.",
"216_b4":"The data we have got by disassembling Martian drones  will made it possible to include them in our squads once we have done some application research.",
"217_done":"The chip cards we can produce in our electronic workshop may be put into the drones’ slots, upgrading their functionality and so effectively improving their attributes. However, the drone must have enough experience for the chip card to be used.",
"217_b4":"If we want to use the drone’s combat experience,we need to develop the hardware to enable us to do this.",
"218_done":"A deeper study of robotic hardware makes production of more effective chip cards possible, enhancing the drones’ attributes more than previously possible. The condition for this upgrade - that the drone must have enough experience - remains the same.",
"218_b4":"After some research in the field of robotic hardware, we could upgrade our drones’ abilities even further.",
"220_done":"The Martian drones’ electronic system can be accessed and controlled with a control device. If our technician successfully completes this operation, it allows him to take command of the robot, effectively making it a part of our squad. Technicians need Automation training to be able to perform this, but the major version of training will enable them to control drones remotely.",
"220_b4":"We could try to create a device enabling us to take control of the Martian drones.",
"221_done":"Because of their ability to manipulate magnetic fields, the Martians are able to access the electronic systems of our combat drones and use them against our units. We can prevent this by equipping the robots with electromagnetic shielding.",
"221_b4":"It seems that Martians have found a way of breaking into our drones’ system and assuming control over them.",
"222_done":"The mechs - great robots walking on two legs - are one of the most dangerous Martian automatons. Their bulk and heavy armor enable them to withstand extensive damage and they are equipped with more dangerous weapons than the other Martian drones. On the other hand, they are slow and vulnerable to electromagnetic pulses and laser. Like most of the robots, the mech cannot detect enemies behind it, because he can see only things in front of itself.",
"222_b4":"Our soldiers brought the body of a Martian giant mech back from a mission. We should study its construction.",
"223_done":"Drones equipped with this kind of turret may be issued with two identical weapons, and are therefore able to cause the enemy twice as much damage. As well as this, the advanced turret has one slot for special robotic accessories.",
"223_b4":"Our drones would be more dangerous if they could carry two weapons, instead of one.",
"224_done":"This turret provides our drones with much better protection than previous. The damage sustained by them will be lower, so we can send them into even the fiercest battles. As well as this, the armored turret has one slot for special robotic accessories.",
"224_b4":"Better protection for our drones would make them able to withstand more damage in battle.",
"225_done":"The faster electronics enable the drone to control four weapons at the same time and to accept special robotic accessories in two slots. The new materials also give the turret better protection from damage.",
"225_b4":"We could develop the robotic turret to be able to carry four weapons using the new technologies.",
"226_done":"Small modifications to the blueprints we brought from Earth have adapted firearms to Mars’ environment. We can now manufacture these effective weapons and their ammo to be used by our soldiers in combat.",
"226_b4":"Firearms were the most typical ranged weapons on Old Earth. We need to adapt their functionality so they can be used on Mars.",
"227_done":"Besides developing special kinds of ammo for the firearms already in use, the results of this research are two specific weapons - a sniper rifle and a shotgun. The former will be very useful over long range and the latter for close combat.",
"227_b4":"Deeper study of firearm’s principles could help us to develop more effective weapons of this kind.",
"228_done":"The gatling consists of several rifle barrels and is able to fire an incredible number of rounds over a very short time. Although its great weight and consumption of ammo makes it an awkward weapon, its effect is more than deadly. Note that you must have Advanced Foundry built before you can manufacture gatlings.",
"228_b4":"Classic firearms do not deal enough damage to be dangerous to our most feared enemies. We need to construct something more deadly.",
"229_done":"Methods and exercises have been developed by our researchers to train the military skills of the colony’s crew that are to participate in tactical missions. These provide a basis for developing other effective combat techniques.",
"229_b4":"We are not used to fighting and that must change fast, otherwise the new enemies will smash us.",
"230_done":"Grenades cause effective damage to all enemies standing near the place of impact. The soldiers does not need any device to throw grenades and quite a lot of them may be carried in the backpack.",
"230_b4":"Explosive weapons are very useful, because they can hurt several enemies at the same time.",
"231_done":"Our soldiers can now be trained in methods of how to protect themselves by using cover more effectively and how to get near to the enemy without being noticed. Attacking from a close range is usually much more dangerous.",
"231_b4":"Our soldiers need to learn technique for getting close to the enemy silently and without being spotted.",
"232_done":"After impact, the contents of our phosphorous rockets will disperse and then immediately burst into flames. Any enemies nearby will be set on fire and will be subjected to burning damage for several seconds until the flames go out.",
"232_b4":"Using inflammable substances in combat could give us an advantage over our enemies.",
"233_done":"Our scientists developed special grenade, whose impact causes strong sound wave, effectively stunning everybody standing in vicinity.",
"233_b4":"Sometimes it is more useful to render an enemy unconscious rather than killing him.",
"234_done":"The device our researchers have developed is installed into a special slot in the spacesuit and guarantees greater precision when aiming with long-range weapons. It monitors the hand-eye coordination between the mechanical parts of the suit and the user and adjusts as necessary.",
"234_b4":"We could try to connect the weapon to the mechanical parts of the spacesuit arms to improve aiming accuracy.",
"235_done":"Our civil engineers were given the plans of how to enlarge our actual tank so the water reserves will last for more than a few days. Even so, if the aqueduct is damaged, we will still have to send a technical team to repair it, only now there will be a leeway of several days.",
"235_b4":"The attack on the aqueduct has made us to think about ways we can ensure sufficient access to water in times of danger.",
"236_done":"We made several changes to the UFO engine, so it can fly faster and so transport our squad to missions quicker. The fuel consumption has neither increased nor decreased.",
"236_b4":"Reticulan records indicate that the UFO could be equipped with stronger engines.",
"237_done":"Instead of our water tank, we could construct a facility able to condense vapor from air, which would then supply our home base with water. This way, we will become independent of the aqueduct and it will become redundant.",
"237_b4":"Terraformation has increased the water vapor content in Mars’ atmosphere. We could try to use this to satisfy our demand for water.",
"238_done":"This modification to our current spacesuit will enable soldiers to carry more equipment into missions. All other characteristics of the suit remain unchanged.",
"238_b4":"Our current spacesuits do not have enough space for soldiers to place reserve ammo, weapons or other equipment.",
"239_done":"A local radar station will notify us about any coming threat, giving us more time to deal with it. It is not necessary to build radars everywhere, but the border regions with their rich mines deserve this kind of protection.",
"239_b4":"Radar could help us to identify approaching enemies and to take appropriate measures to prevent them from doing any harm.",
"240_done":"Adjusting the engines in the vehicles that scientists and technicians use for transport has made them faster. Now it doesn’t take as long to reach the place where an outside station is to be constructed and so the teams’ work will become more efficient.",
"240_b4":"An engine modification could make scientific and technical vehicles move faster around the planet.",
"241_done":"The fuel found at various places on Mars is very similar to Earth‘s crude oil. As such, it can be used for fuelling the powerplant, producing much more energy than we have had until now.",
"241_b4":"The solar power plant cannot cope with the increasing demand for energy. We must find other ways of satisfying it.",
"242_done":"Applying the same principle used in Reticulan batteries gives us the opportunity of building a reactor that can supply sufficient energy for our home base as well as all the stations around Mars. This is going to be very important if we want to take another step in terraforming the planet.",
"242_b4":"Employing the Reticulan technology of obtaining energy on a larger scale could solve the potential scarcity of this resource.",
"243_done":"Thorough research in the field of technical perception enables the manufacture of equipment that will help our soldiers. Scopes may be adjusted to the weapons to increase their precision, and visual aids will be very useful if their normal sight distance is reduced.",
"243_b4":"We could try to make our observation devices more precise and sensitive.",
"244_done":"The scanners we have developed during this research, enable metal objects like mines or moving creatures that are otherwise hard to notice to be detected.",
"244_b4":"Not all threats can be detected by our soldier’s eyes or ears. Our scientists should find ways of assisting them.",
"245_done":"The life support armor’s protection characteristics are almost the same as that of the advanced heavy armor.  It however offers better environmental resistance, so the soldiers wearing it can move about freely anywhere on Mars. The life support device automatically heals soldier’s stun injuries during battle and first aid sets heal more temporary hit points than usual.",
"245_b4":"Linking our current knowledge of medicine and electronics could bring important advances to help our soldiers in combat.",
"246_done":"This heavy-duty suit offers better protection against combat damage and is especially adapted to prevent damage caused by the harsh environment. Although it is a bit cumbersome and the soldiers have to get used to wearing it, they can now go to places where they would have previously died.",
"246_b4":"Our soldiers cannot take part in missions to regions with a hostile environment. We should develop a suit enabling this.",
"247_done":"Advanced medium armor offers the same flexibility as the basic medium battle suit, but it prevents more damage and contains one additional slot for special armor accessories. This is the best armor we have, which does not require any special training to wear.",
"247_b4":"If we combine the knowledge of the Beastmen’s super-plastics and enhanced armor construction, we could develop an extremely useful battle suit.",
"248_done":"Heavy metal plates make this spacesuit the most suitable for combat situations. It protects effectively against most kinds of damage, only it is a little hard to move around in.",
"248_b4":"As the enemies use more and more effective weapons, we badly need to develop armor with really good protection.",
"249_done":"A thick sheet of metal is not the only thing that protects the soldier wearing this battle suit. Electronic sensors try to foresee approaching danger and adapt the armor’s structure accordingly, so preventing even more injuries than normal heavy armor.",
"249_b4":"Enhancing heavy armor with electronic devices could make it more useful in combat.",
"250_done":"Light armor we developed is based on classical spacesuits, only some light metal plates were added to vulnerable places. No special training is needed to wear it.",
"250_b4":"We can try to add some light protection to our spacesuits.",
"251_done":"Our technicians can now deploy contact mines in the terrain and then lure the enemy to enter the area. Defending important strategic points is also made easier this way.",
"251_b4":"Using contact mines may give us an advantage in tactical missions.",
"252_done":"We can now reproduce Reticulan building technology and start construction of new domes, which will protect their inhabitants from Mars’ uninhabitable environment. We can place the new interior buildings that we need for our development in these cupolas.",
"252_b4":"The habitable space in the home base begins to shrink as we construct new interior buildings. We should find a way of making this bigger.",
"253_done":"The original communication between Mars and Council of Earth was based on Reticulan technologies. We are now able to reuse radio wave technology to try to contact the Council or anybody else on the Earth who is able to reply and inform us what happened.",
"253_b4":"We have an emergency system that could be used  if communication with Council of Earth is interrupted. The scientists must fine-tune a few details in order to make it operational.",
"254_done":"Analysis of the vast data files sent from Earth open up a handful of opportunities for our further growth. Now we have a lot of detailed information about weapon construction, material processing, combat tactics and so on. Our researchers just need to apply this information to our specific circumstances.",
"254_b4":"Some of the knowledge we had on Earth has been lost during our stay on Mars. We have an opportunity to renew it.",
"255_done":"We have made a revolutionary discovery through studying the material we call fuel. Fuel is the fossil remnant of organisms similar to the biomass that flooded Earth 50 years ago. We’re talking about millions years of history and our answers will probably create even more questions. Was the original Martian civilization destroyed by biomass? Did Reticulans already exist in those ancient times doing their filthy experiments on other planets?",
"255_b4":"It is a mystery how the material we use as fuel got to Mars. Solving this puzzle may also help us in exploiting this resource.",
"256_done":"Martians disappeared from the planet several million years before our arrival. It seems that they left intentionally and did not suddenly become extinct. Where they went we cannot tell at this moment, but the Martian archives will probably contain the answers to most of our questions. What we can be very sure about, is that their scientific knowledge was extraordinary, especially in the field of magnetism and plasma physics.",
"256_b4":"Studying the excavation site findings may reveal some interesting information about the lost Martian civilization.",
"257_done":"The Martians were very familiar with the surrounding universe. According to their records, they visited at least one star besides the Sun. Their knowledge of the Solar system confirms our theories about its past. The only exception is that the Martians do not display two Mars moons on their astronomy charts. We may only hazard a guess as to what this may mean. Maybe the moons are not natural, but were constructed as giant spaceships for interstellar travels.",
"257_b4":"The only Martian files we are able to decode at this moment refer to astronomy. Still it might be useful to exploit any information we have found.",
"258_done":"Reticulan ideas about UFO construction made several modifications possible. These enable our flying saucer to travel safely into open space. We cannot travel between planets, but the short trip into orbit to visit Mars’ moons can easily be made.",
"258_b4":"We must find a way of getting to Phobos and Deimos. Maybe we could modify the UFO for this purpose?",
"259_done":"The knowledge base we gained by studying the Laputian scientific files give us the opportunity to develop new weapons and accessories. They also contain some data about constructing  lightweight, but highly protective armor.",
"259_b4":"The Laputians sent us their files containing records about some advanced technologies. They deserve a thorough analysis.",
"260_done":"This technology enables our computers’ miniaturization, so they can perform difficult tasks even when integrated into spacesuits or weapons. Moreover, the computing power may be useful in decoding Martian archives and learning the language of this ancient civilization.",
"260_b4":"If we can shrink the size of the processor and increase its performance, our computers will be even more useful, especially in combat situations.",
"261_done":"Soldiers equipped with a rocket-launcher and a backpack full of rockets (or grenade-launcher with hand grenades) can send doom into an enemies’ ranks, if he receives training in how to use these weapons. Further research may allow the rockets to be used for ammunition other than explosives.",
"261_b4":"Rockets could be very useful against tough and strong enemies.",
"262_done":"The Reticulans are physically a weak race, relying mostly on their hi-tech equipment and psionic abilities. They cannot withstand much damage and are easily hurt especially by explosives, on the other hand they are resistant to lasers. They can detect our soldiers with their psionic senses. Our soldiers can be taught which parts of the Reticulan’s bodies are the most effective to hit.",
"262_b4":"By dissecting a Reticulan’s body, we could learn a lot about their anatomy and physiology and use this data in combat.",
"263_done":"The thing that makes Reticulans such a dangerous opponent is their psionic weapons. For more detailed research, we must first get hold of some, but it seems that even then our soldiers may not be able to use them. Only the Reticulan race retains psionic abilities, and these seem to become weaker, at least in comparison with what we know from the war at the Earth.",
"263_b4":"Reticulan soldiers could give us important information about Reticulan weapon technologies.",
"264_done":"The information we have received from the interrogation completely changes our ideas about Reticulans. The group that attacked Earth acted on its own and they were going completely against their ruler’s orders. Their goal was to make Earth a home for some giant interstellar organism. They were successful and it was their doom. When the organism was safely established, a few months after our arrival on Mars, it sent a strong psionic signal, kind of loud cry, and it killed or debilitated most of the Reticulans. That is why they are such weak and dull opponents.",
"264_b4":"If we can get answers to our questions about Reticulan civilization, a lot of new information may be revealed.",
"265_done":"Reticulan expedition troops use a similar device to psionic weapons, but much more refined. They can enter the mind of any living being and persuade it to do as they command. This is the way our soldiers are forced to turn against their comrades. Nobody without psionic abilities can use the special device - mind controller - and stronger the psionic abilities of the user, the wider range the mind controller has and the more dangerous it is.",
"265_b4":"Reticulan Expedition soldiers could tell us something about the way they get control over our soldiers.",
"266_done":"Psionic weapons are Reticulan embryos that work together with the weapon’s user, strengthening and directing his psionic abilities. The Reticulan user will decide if he wants to hurt, to stun or to just confuse the victim. The stronger psionic abilities the Reticulan has, the harder it is to resist the effect of the weapon. On the other hand, soldiers with strong willpower have a better chance of protecting themselves.",
"266_b4":"The most dangerous Reticulan weapons take effect directly in  their victim’s brain.",
"267_done":"The psi absorber we developed may be attached to armor via a special slot, and it will counteract most of psionic energy entering a soldier’s brain. Will power training is still important, but psionic attacks now present a much lesser threat for a properly equipped soldier.",
"267_b4":"We need some method of protecting our troops against psionic attacks.",
"268_done":"Crystal deposits can be found all over Mars. Our geosondes have been automatically reprogrammed to search for them, and it is quite possible that a few will even be in our current territory. As soon as some has been located, we can start building mining stations.",
"268_b4":"If we want to manufacture new equipment, we will have to prospect for crystals.",
"269_done":"Our researchers have created blueprints for two types of laser weapon – the rifle and cannon. We were not able to find a way of producing a one-handed laser weapon, so we’ll have to rely on Reticulan laser pistols.",
"269_b4":"Laser can be very an effective weapon, especially against enemies immune to projectiles.",
"270_done":"Reticulans use a similar principle to thermonuclear fusion to produce energy, even in small energy sources like batteries. Effective and miniaturized sources of energy enable further research in the areas of terraformation, combat and many others.",
"270_b4":"It would be useful to discover the secret of how the Reticulans obtain such a huge amount of energy",
"271_done":"The defensive force field we have developed can be attached to armor via its special accessory slot. It repels fast-moving bullets, and so effectively protects against projectile weapons.",
"271_b4":"Powerful batteries could be used to power another Reticulan invention - the force field.",
"272_done":"Two important discoveries were made on our mission to Phobos and Deimos. The first concerns the moons themselves - these are actually the gigantic organisms that came to Mars millions of years ago and brought with them a mysterious civilization. Martians have lately inhabited one of the moons. Everything points to the fact that Mars has been affected by the same disaster that struck Earth 50 years ago. The voyage’s second success was obtaining photo shots of Mars’ surface. Now, we know the locations of all hyperspace gates and the Beastmen’s main fortress.",
"272_b4":"Our scientists brought back a lot of data from their voyage to Mars’ moons. We need to do a complete analysis before it can be used.",
"273_done":"Our discoveries completely change our idea about the history of Mars. Not Martians, but Beastmen are the planet’s original inhabitants. The Martians arrived with the Myrmecols, won the following war against their enemies from the second Myrmecols and Beastmen too. Instead of destroying the Beastmen, they sent them to a distant planet via hyperspace gates. The Beastmen waited there patiently preparing themselves for their return and for wresting Mars from the hands of the intruders.",
"273_b4":"Some of the knowledge we have gained about Mars’ history contradicts itself. We should learn where the truth lies.",
"274_done":"We have made a more thorough analysis of all the camera shots made during the mission and connected these to the other scientific observations, especially the magnetic field changes. The gate is probably not of Beastman origin, because its technology is beyond their reach. We have a theory that there may be more gates on the planet, but we cannot say how many, where they are and where they may lead.",
"274_b4":"The device that was activated during our mission to the excavation site, is, without doubt, a hyperspace gate. We should try to learn more about it.",
"275_done":"If we integrate our current radar stations with short-range rocket ramps, they could be used to attack approaching enemy raiding parties and destroying them before they reach their goal, so our soldiers need not to take care of it.",
"275_b4":"Our UFO cannot be everywhere. We should find another way of protecting our territory.",
"276_done":"From now on, our soldier can use Beastman firearms and grenades. They might have problems with their handling, but the weapons generally cause more damage than ours.",
"276_b4":"By interrogating one of the Beastman soldiers we could learn how to handle their weapons.",
"277_done":"The Beastman alchemist had an extensive knowledge about chemistry, unknown to us up to now. Apart from the basic principles of acid weapons, he revealed completely new potential methods of healing and curing our soldiers.",
"277_b4":"The Beastmen we call alchemists look after chemical processes and manufacture.",
"278_done":"The Beastmen enhance their fighting skills even further with extremely effective stimulative drugs. We have some hints about their manufacture, as well as about how the Beastmen’s plastic armor is constructed.",
"278_b4":"The Beastman commander could tell us a lot about their battle tactics and equipment.",
"280_done":"The matriarch’s answers about the Beastmen’s history did not make much sense. She was talking about their race as if they were outcasts, how they had spent many years making themselves strong enough to win their home back from the intruders. It seems like they return to Mars instead of conquering the new world.",
"280_b4":"The Matriarch holds the highest rank in the Beastmen’s hierarchy. They must know a lot about their society and culture.",
"281_done":"These worms spit acid at their enemies from close quarters. Their skin offers them almost no protection against projectiles or other weapons. They come in two varieties - the more dangerous are the clear worms, because they are almost invisible and can get very close without being noticed.",
"281_b4":"The study of this beast’s body structure may reveal its weak spots.",
"282_done":"The Beastmen’s technology for producing super light and yet hardwearing plastics is surprisingly simple. They use special ingredients to start a chemical reaction that creates the item in the shape desired. Using this, we could develop new kinds of armor for our soldiers.",
"282_b4":"Beastmen are able to produce plastics that are both hard wearing and light. We should learn this secret.",
"283_done":"Operating Beastman weapons is a bit awkward for human beings. They are large and heavy, just like the Beastmen. However, they deal more damage than human firearms and we could use special types of Beastman ammo against our enemies.",
"283_b4":"The Beastman’s firearms surpass our own in some of their characteristics. It would be great if we could use these against them.",
"284_done":"At this time, the best use of these super-plastics is to make armor, that is not as cumbersome as heavy armor, but at the same time more protective than light armor. Soldiers can move much more freely in a spacesuit made from this material due to its flexibility.",
"284_b4":"We need to study some details in order to produce functional items from Beastman super-plastics.",
"285_done":"The best way of including acid weapons as part of our arsenal is through the production of acid filled grenades instead of using classic explosives. The acid splashes out after impact and covers anything in reach with a thin corrosive layer, causing injury lasting several seconds or until it is washed off.",
"285_b4":"Acid weapons are deadly against most targets, as this substance adheres to the skin and hurts the victim for several seconds.",
"287_done":"The Martian archives  probably hold all data about science, history and the life of this lost civilization. We could find treasures there that would give us a decisive advantage over our enemies. At first, however, we must learn the Martian’s language . We may be able to decode the files with exact scientific data and discover the basic language structures in that way. Any information that would give us  clues would be priceless. That’s why we should collect as many Martian artifacts from the excavation sites as we can.",
"287_b4":"The archives of this ancient civilization are a huge source of potential knowledge. We should learn more about them.",
"288_done":"We have gained some basic orientation in simple texts. We are able to read mostly theoretical scientific texts, where numbers and figures play a major part. To be able to learn more, we need a fast computer so we can perform a complete and thorough analysis of all available data.",
"288_b4":"The first insights into the Martian archives give us some idea of how to advance in the study of their language.",
"289_done":"After huge efforts, our researchers have decoded the last details of this ancient civilization’s language and sorted all data into categories for further study. The most appealing seems to be information concerning electro-magnetism and plasma. Knowledge of this would make the production of new more effective weapons possible. However, at this stage, we can only read and write. We have no idea how the language was used in everyday life among Martians",
"289_b4":"We are just a few steps from discovering one of the greatest mysteries - the Martian language.",
"290_done":"Martians finely modulate electromagnetic fields to express their “words”. Human beings are unable to understand it, as we have no senses able to perceive this communication. However, we have built a device serving as a translator for our communication officer, so she can start direct negotiations with the Martians.",
"290_b4":"If we want to communicate directly with the Martians, we should learn to speak their language.",
"291_done":"It seems that the Martians should be able to live in an environment very similar to the one on Earth. Only slight changes need to be made to the magnetic field and the atmosphere’s gas content to make terraformation acceptable to them. People could easily survive in the open in these conditions, , it would only need small adjustments. To reprogram terraforming stations would take just a matter of hours.",
"291_b4":"Maybe we could find a way to make the terraforming process tolerable to the original inhabitants of Mars.",
"292_done":"Martians’ bodies are very different from all other races we know. They are more plants than animals. Their metabolism is much slower, but they can still move relatively quickly, although they cannot dodge as readily as we can, for example. Because of their structure, projectiles do not injure them too much. The edged weapons are very injuring to Martians as well as fire damage. When concentrating, they can change the flow of the light rays around them, effectively making themselves invisible.",
"292_b4":"By dissecting a Martian’s body, we may learn a lot about their anatomy and physiology and use this data in combat.",
"293_done":"The Martian soldier revealed important facts about plasma principles and their application during the interrogation. Our researchers should process the information and try to prepare the data for production of plasma equipment.",
"293_b4":"The Martian weapons are effective and deadly, but we have no idea how to operate them. One of their fighters could tell us.",
"295_done":"The Martian pet’s body is similar to the Martians. It is a plant-like creature able to modulate an electromagnetic field. It protects itself and its masters by the electromagnetic pulses. On the other hand, the pulses are so weak and its body so vulnerable, that they are probably really more pets than the battle beasts we know from the Beastmen.",
"295_b4":"We have often met this beast messing around the Martians. It does not seem dangerous, but maybe we should find out more.",
"296_done":"We have discovered the theoretical principles necessary to create devices that are able to manipulate an electromagnetic field at will. These will require some energy before they will happen, but we should be able to produce hand weapons, scanners and similar equipment after further research.",
"296_b4":"If we can simulate the Martians’ ability to manipulate an EM field, we may be able to create EM equipment and advance in terraformation process.",
"297_done":"The biggest problem is to find enough energy to transform matter into a plasma state. Once we can do that, we should be able to manipulate the clouds of plasma created to bring destruction to our enemies. However, such weapons will not be easy to handle properly.",
"297_b4":"Using plasma in combat seems to be very devastating. Studying this state of matter may turn out to be very useful.",
"298_done":"Plasma cannons work in two modes. They can either produce a big ball of plasma, which is sent to hit one specific target, or they create a cone of hot plasma, which sweeps over everyone in its way. The cannons are constructed to be used by Martians, so human soldiers may have slight problems in operating them.",
"298_b4":"Plasma cannons are the most dangerous weapons Martians and their robots wield in combat. It would be great if our troops could use them.",
"299_done":"Our scientists have created the necessary blueprints for production of a human plasma cannon - the annihilator. It should be more effective than the Martian ones, as the plasma contains particles of antimatter, making it even more destructive than “ordinary” hot plasma. The annihilator uses normal batteries, but its energy consumption is remarkable.",
"299_b4":"Now it is time to create our own ultimate plasma weapon - an annihilator.",
"300_done":"It will be hard for our soldiers to use Martian EM weapons, but it is possible. With some effort, they can learn how to operate them, but they will never be able to use them in the same way that Martians do. The members of that race can enhance the weapon’s performance with their ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields, effectively increasing its accuracy, range and damage.",
"300_b4":"Martians seem to be much more vulnerable to EM pulses than bullets. We should try to use their own weapons against them.",
"301_done":"The blueprints of an magnetic rifle are now available and the technicians can start its manufacture. Weapon users can choose between a weaker pulse with longer range or devastating lightning inflicting major damage, but consuming a lot of energy from the battery and taking a longer time to aim.",
"301_b4":"Our soldiers could handle EM weapons of our own design more effectively than Martian ones.",
"302_done":"The Martians are similar to trees, and trees can be taken out  with a saw. We have developed special circular blades for our buzz-saws, which tear Martian tissue and cause them extensive damage. To be able to attack Martians from a distance, the blueprints of the blades are available for manufacture.",
"302_b4":"Firearms are not very effective against the Martians’ combat tactics. We should try other ways of fighting them.",
"303_done":"By monitoring the electromagnetic field, we can see objects or creatures invisible to the naked human eye, for example metal mines or camouflaged Martians. We can either produce special optical add-ons for spacesuits or scanners able to explore a large area in single sweep.",
"303_b4":"It might be useful to develop devices able to monitor changes to the electromagnetic field.",
"304_done":"This project has resulted in two findings - one applicable to defense and the other to attacks. The two add-ons can be attached to the spacesuit slots. The first one highly increases protection against EM pulses, the other one adds to the strength and range of the EM weapons the soldiers wield.",
"304_b4":"Deeper study of electromagnetic manipulation may give us greater advantages over our enemies.",
"305_done":"This research has enabled us to divert light waves away from an object, so making it almost invisible to anyone relying on normal vision. It can be used either individually as add-on to a spacesuit, or like the single shot device, effectively cloaking anyone in its range. However, be careful, the cloaking only works if the cloaked person does not move.",
"305_b4":"Our knowledge of electromagnetic manipulation should allow us to simulate the Martians’ impressive talent - for perfect camouflage.",
"306_done":"We can build a medium-sized water condensation facility that is able to collect enough water to irrigate large areas of the planetary surface, creating suitable conditions for plant growth. This is only one stage in the process of terraformation, but an extremely important one.",
"306_b4":"Irrigating Mars’ surface could prove a breakthrough to progressing terraformation.",
"307_done":"Our team has changed the genetic code of some plants so that they reproduce really fast and will cover vast areas in just few days or weeks, if provided with suitable conditions. This should release enormous amounts of oxygen into the atmosphere in a short period of time, enabling humans to breath the air.",
"307_b4":"Using the Beastmen’s technology of biological manipulation could speed up Mars’ terraformation dramatically.",
"308_done":"If we place the devices we have developed during this project evenly around the planet, they will gradually start  to strengthen the planet’s magnetic field. This will stop the atmosphere from escaping into space. This opportunity could be a decisive step in the  journey to a terraformed Mars.",
"308_b4":"Applying electromagnetic principles learned from the Martians could change the planet’s magnetic field  so enabling further terraformation of Mars.",
"309_done":"The research team have handed the terraformation station’s ground plan to the technicians together with the list of devices it should contain. If we build as many of these stations as we can all around the planet, the terraformation process will gradually start. This way, the environment on Mars should enable the people who are going to wake up from their cryogenic sleep next year to survive, but it is still nowhere near to making Mars a copy of old Earth.",
"309_b4":"It is time to start the terraformation process. All necessary research has been done, we just need to start the process.",
"310_done":"Combining the technologies of irrigation, rapid plant growth and magnetic field strengthening may boost the speed of terraformation greatly. Our technicians should upgrade as many of our terraformation stations as possible. It may sound like a miracle, but this way, Mars could become perfectly habitable in the course of a year or two.",
"310_b4":"If we combine the suitable technologies, we could make the terraformation process much faster.",
"311_done":"This new weapon - the lightning ball thrower - creates a sufficient amount of plasma, which is steered by electromagnetic manipulation. The soldier firing this weapon can change the lightning ball’s direction , send it behind a cornet and get it to explode wherever it will have the most devastating effect. Controlling the ball requires driver training.",
"311_b4":"Combining our knowledge about plasma and EM manipulation could result in the creation of a completely new weapon.",
"312_done":"The medics can use two new stimulants to treat our soldiers on the battlefield. One of them slightly improves all basic abilities, the second one strongly supports the soldier’s concentration and boosts his or her dexterity and willpower. Moreover, they have no side effects.",
"312_b4":"We could try to adapt the extremely effective stimulants Beastmen use for human soldiers.",
"313_done":"This object is used as a medkit of some sort or the other. We are not very sure about its function as the Beastmen’s biochemistry is different to humans. However, we have noticed that these medkits are mostly used by the units we call alchemists.",
"313_b4":"This object was found on one of the Beastmen after the battle. It might be useful to learn more about it.",
"314_done":"We have discovered the solution to one of the biggest secrets of this war. Under normal circumstances, Mars elements move randomly and attack our soldiers and our enemies equally. This has not been the case with Beastmen - elements have never attacked them and instead just steadily advance on our troops. The device we have just examined is the reason for this behavior. The Beastmen have found a way of controlling the elements and use them as a weapon.",
"314_b4":"This object was found on one of the Beastmen after the battle. It might be useful to learn more about it.",
"315_done":"Despite trying everything, we have not been able to discover this object’s function. Obviously, the Beastman’s way of thinking is very different to ours and it is not possible for us to understand everything from their culture.",
"315_b4":"This object was found on one of the Beastmen after the battle. It might be useful to learn more about it.",
"316_done":"This device is able to monitor almost imperceptible body sounds like heartbeat. It is extremely useful for detecting unarmored beasts like the Beastmen’s pets, but our soldiers can be identified with it as well. Our troops can take the heartbeat scanner on missions and use it from now on.",
"316_b4":"This object was found on one of the Beastmen after the battle. It might be useful to learn more about it.",
"317_done":"Until now, we have managed with metals like iron or copper. We will need other metals such as titan or gold to create more subtle alloys with specific qualities that can be used for production of weapons or armor that will be more effective in the future. We will need to build a foundry to process these kinds of metals.",
"317_b4":"To further our development we require a more in depth study of metal smelting and processing.",
"320_done":"Open armor can be worn in places where terraformation has progressed so much that the environment reminds one more of Earth than Mars. It is extraordinarily light and can be worn freely by anyone, but it still offers comparable protection against combat damage to other spacesuits in this category.",
"320_b4":"Terraformation has advanced so much that we can concentrate on just protecting against combat damage instead of the hostile environment.",
"321_done":"The mind controller’s function is obvious - it seizes control over the will of affected person and forces him or her to carry out the commands of Reticulan. Nobody without psionic abilities can use this device, and stronger the psionic abilities of the user, the wider range the mind controller has and the more dangerous it is.",
"321_b4":"Information we gained from Expedition soldier seems to be referred to that mind controlling device we have obtained before.",
"322_done":"The embryo that is part of this device can enter the mind of the person and literally persuade his or her organism to cure itself. The great thing is that the healer need not stand next to the injured person. The stronger the psionic abilities of the healing Reticulan are, the further the range of the device.",
"322_b4":"Reticulans use this device, which is similar to their psionic weapons, to heal themselves instead of using normal medkits.",
"323_done":"Instead of an explosive filling, this rocket contains one of the Reticulan embryos. It dies on impact, but just before its death it sends an extremely strong psionic signal. Our soldiers describe the feeling as if their soul is ripped out and sent crying into an abyss. The effect is devastating, causing mostly stun damage.",
"323_b4":"Our soldiers are really afraid of those rockets. They damage the body as well as the mind.",
"324_done":"It seems that the Martians’ competence with electromagnetic fields enables them to sometimes assume control over our robots and turn them against the rest of the squad. If we can equip our robots with some sort of EM shading, this problem could be prevented.",
"324_b4":"When we fight against Martians, our drones sometimes cease to react to our commands and start attacking our own troops.",
"325_done":"Finally, we have a clearer idea of what destroyed our Earth. A group of Reticulans were taken over by an interstellar organism called Myrmecol - as a psionic race they were highly susceptible. They rebelled against the collective consciousness of their civilization and set out on a journey, looking for a planet where the Myrmecol could breed. They found Earth and used their advanced technologies to get rid of the only thing standing in their way - humans. Expedition arrived to learn what happened and punish the rebels.",
"325_b4":"Someone high in the Reticulan hierarchy could clarify those events in our past, which are still cloaked in shadow.",
"327_done":"The first step in studying alien races is looking at their biology. Research in this area will require exact scientific methods, technologies and tools in order to give useful results. Our technicians can construct a building enabling them to autopsy and learn from dead alien corpses.",
"327_b4":"We should develop methods and tools for studying alien anatomy and physiology.",
"328_done":"We have applied the principles of electromagnetic pulse manipulation in a way Martians have never managed. It shows the greatest strength of the human race - our will to survive whatever the circumstances that we find ourselves in. After impact the EM grenade releases a strong electromagnetic pulse, badly hurting all susceptible victims in its vicinity.",
"328_b4":"It would be great to have weapons able to cause EM damage to a greater number of enemies simultaneously.",
"329_done":"Reticulan technologies are far more advanced than ours. They have an extensive knowledge, mostly concerning both the production and use of energy. The archives contain a lot of data about our UFO and the methods of mining new resources that might shortly be needed - crystals and noble metals. Once we apply everything we have learned from the Reticulans, we’ll gain a decisive advantage over our enemies.",
"329_b4":"We need to sort through the content of the Reticulan database to learn what we can use from their experience.",
"330_done":"When the Reticulans gave us their database, it would appear that they removed important data referring to their greatest secrets: powerful miniaturized batteries able to supply energy for hand weapons and ways of protecting people against their psionic weapons. We can start researching in those areas as well.",
"330_b4":"Even though the original Reticulan files we have studied seemed to be very comprehensive and detailed, it appears that there is yet more we can learn from this race.",
"331_done":"Our scientists have developed the ground plans for warehouses to store metals, chemicals and fuel. This will allow us to accumulate these raw materials at the home base, enabling better access and ensuring that we are not so dependent on the distant mines.",
"331_b4":"If we store some of the raw materials at our home base, we can use more of them for manufacturing or construction.",
"332_done":"A language tells us a lot about a nation and its culture. The Beastmen are born warriors. Their vocabulary contains hundreds of words describing warfare, combat and fighting. On the other hand, they are almost unable to talk about more subtle matters like art. Something else that must be noted: they do not have a word for “peace” or “ceasefire”.",
"332_b4":"All our attempts to communicate with this race came to grief. Maybe we should take more time to study their language.",
"333_done":"Rollers are not like any organism we know from Earth. They roll their huge body towards their opponent and when they are close, great bone blades stretch from their skin and hurt the enemy. Their skin is surprisingly resistant to projectiles and explosions, but their tissues are susceptible to fire.",
"333_b4":"The study of this beast’s body structure may reveal its weak spots.",
"334_done":"Although we call them spiders, these beasts only have four legs. They can spit acid at short range or smash their enemy with either one of their legs, which end in razor-sharp barbs. We have met two varieties of the spider:  the purple one is not as armored and strong as the orange spider, but its acid attack is much more dangerous.",
"334_b4":"The study of this beast’s body structure may reveal its weak spots.",
"335_done":"The name - Boss - was given to this beast by our soldiers, because of the way he rules over the battlefield. It is very hard to kill him since he can endure a great amount of damage, and the small particles the boss spits are as lethal as rifle bullets. It is almost impossible to get around him, but his vulnerable place might be the back - he cannot spit in that direction.",
"335_b4":"The study of this beast’s body structure may reveal its weak spots.",
"336_done":"Noble metal deposits can be found at various locations on the planet. Our geosondes will start prospecting our territory immediately. Technicians will then construct a mine station on the spot where a find is made as soon as is practicable. Sufficient supplies of noble metals is are needed for our further development.",
"336_b4":"Mining noble metals requires special technologies and tools.",
"337_done":"Application of special chemical procedures can decrease the amounts of raw material that are left unused in debris. Our current mines must first be upgraded, but after this, their production should increase by twofold compared to before the upgrade.",
"337_b4":"It seems that Reticulans could extract much more raw material from their deposits. We should try to duplicate their technology.",
"338_done":"Our scientists has developed accessory to laser weapons that shorten the cooling time before the next attack, but the decreased intensity of the laser beam cause shorter range as well.",
"338_b4":"Our lasers tend to overheat when firing intensively. We should try to find a way how to overcome this problem.",
"339_done":"Technicians have now developed plans for producing  several weapon accessories:  a recoil compensator, gyrostabilizer, and accelerator. They enhance various firearm qualities, enabling our soldiers to use them more accurately and dealing more damage to our enemies. Each accessory has two variants - simple, but cheap, and advanced, but more expensive to manufacture.",
"339_b4":"We could try to develop some accessories assisting soldiers with the aim of projectile weapons.",
"340_done":"The silencer we have developed suppresses the sound and light the shots create. It should be attached to the muzzle slot of the weapon and cannot be exchanged during battle. Firearms with this accessory are especially useful on stealth missions, where a soldier has to move unobserved.",
"340_done":"The silencer we have developed suppresses the sound and light the shots create. It should be attached to the muzzle slot of the weapon and cannot be exchanged during battle. Firearms with this accessory are especially useful on stealth missions, where a soldier has to move unobserved.",
"340_b4":"The shots from projectile weapons are audible and visible from a great distance. We should try to silence them so as not to attract the enemies’ attention.",
"341_done":"The first logical step was making our laser shots stronger. The shot now deals more damage, but this comes at a cost of bigger energy consumption. On the other hand, the heating process has even more intensive positive effect, but in exchange for longer shooting time and energy consumption as well.",
"341_b4":"We could try to enhance our laser weapons with useful accessories.",
"342_done":"The heavier and less penetrable the armor, the less personal smell escapes to the surrounding air. We have developed a device – a small absorber that can further suppress the smell, if attached to the armor’s add-on slot. This should prevent Beastmen from detecting our soldiers.",
"342_b4":"No matter how careful our soldiers are, Beastmen always find them by their smell.",
"343_done":"Although we call them matriarchs, it cannot be said that these creatures are female. They were biologically modified to be the perfect chiefs - strong,  skilful and cunning. If the normal Beastmen soldiers are a very dangerous enemy, this  is twice as true of the Beastmen’s matriarchs. She is very agile, dodging most of the attacks. When hit, she is not easily hurt, with the exception of laser damage and probably psionic attacks.",
"343_b4":"The Beastmen’s rulers are our most impressive opponents. We can learn a bit more about them by studying their dead bodies.",
