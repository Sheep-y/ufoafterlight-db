<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
I am an interactive database for the game <a href="http://www.ufo-afterlight.com/">UFO: Afterlight</a>, a sci-fi strategic game published in 2007.
I am fan-made and, as of Nov 2014, I should be the most complete and accurate Afterlight database on Internet.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Simple</b>: Easy to use both on desktop and on mobile</li>
  <li><b>Complete</b>: Includes stations, items, trainings, and even unused entries.</li>
  <li><b>Two way</b>: Can shows what would <a href="?query=Firearms">a technology</a> gives you, or weapons that use <a href="?query=Beastman AP ammo">an ammo</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Smart</b>: Trace special resources, energy, trainings, and other special relationships.</li>
  <li><b>Fast</b>: Everything is contained in one small web page. Does not need server.</li>
  <li><b>Open</b>: You can <a href="https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/data/">read</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/tree/development/res/">enhance</a> me if you <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript">learned programming</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>
I depends on JavaScript, and is tested on Firefox 33 and IE 11.
You can report bugs or request enhancements using <a href="https://github.com/Sheep-y/ufoafterlight-db/issues">my issue tracker</a>.
</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
At top of the page is various external links.
Below the links are main categories, such as buildings or items.
Clicking them will bring you to the index of those data.
Clicking the clear button will also brings you back to this index.
</p>
<p>
You can click the item in the index, or type in the search box.
Clicking the box will show you a list of all available items, and typing will narrow down the list.
(In <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>, you can type any part of the term.)
While at data index you can also use the browser's find function to search for part of terms.
</p>
<p>
If you are a modder or otherwise working with game data, you can also type or paste the data's numeric id or internal name.
If I find exact matches I will display them.
</p>
<p>
When an entry is selected, either by clicking its name or by typing its name, its data and relationships will be displayed.
Clicking the name of any entry will bring you to that entry.
You can use the browser's back and forward to navigate the history.
You can also right click or Ctrl+Click the names to open it in new tab instead.
</p>
<p>
To show or hide the description of an entry, click the question mark below and to the left of its name.
To expand or collapse a requirement tree, click the plus and minus button to the right of its name.
Repeated appearance of a subtree will be collapsed to avoid redundancy.
</p>
<p>
Keyboard hotkeys can also be used for some actions, displayed as underline.
The exact keys depends on browser; on Windows it is usually <kbd>Alt+Shift+key</kbd>, e.g. <kbd>Alt+Shift+C</kbd> to clear and go back to index, or <kbd>Alt+Shift+E</kbd> to jump to the search box.
Keyboard navigation within search result is limited to tabbing.

<p>
UFO:Afterlight is a pretty deep game, with a very complex tech tree that affects many parts of the game, while limited by these parts at the same time.
Just look at <a href="?query=Advanced Terraforming Station">Advanced Terraforming Station</a>s, required to win the game.  But they <a href="?query=Magnetic Rifle">alone</a> <a href="?query=Power Shield">are</a> <a href="?query=Computerised Heavy Suit">insufficient</a> to win.
</p>
<p>
This has frustrated many players.
Often, even veterans cannot answer a question accurately - most knowledge and experience is lost after the official forum and wiki went down in 2009.
Many tech trees have been created, with varying degree of success, from total failure to <a href="http://ufoafterblank.wikia.com/wiki/File:Al_techtree_laine.gif">barely usable</a> to <a href="http://ufoafterblank.wikia.com/wiki/File:Al_techtree_frenchman.gif">pretty pleasant</a>.
</p>
<p>
In 2014, Kircket tried <a href='http://www.irodemine.com/afterlit/'>another approach</a>.
Instead of displaying the whole tree, it asks you select a node and shows its requirements, dramatically cutting down on what needs to be displayed.
Not long after, Sheepy adopted the wiki on Wikia and started drafting a <a href="http://ufoafterblank.wikia.com/wiki/File:al_techtree_sheepy.jpg">new tech chart</a>.
They had a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/237950/discussions/0/616188677801999309/#c619568793974409287">discussion on Steam</a>, which prompted my birth as a proof that server is not required.
</p>
<p>
Sheepy found that the database actually helped in constructing the wiki, and in playing the game, so developments continued on and off, and ultimately you have me in your hands.
Hope you enjoy me and find me useful.
